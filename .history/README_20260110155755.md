# Planning

The planning phase for the **Miriam Gradel** platform began with a strong emphasis on **brand definition**.  
Working closely with **Marie Pilot**, we developed a cohesive visual and narrative identity for Miriam, that reflects her voice and personality as a journalist, her professionalism, and the clarity and precision of her communication work.

Rather than relying on formal user personas, the direction was shaped through a **brand-driven approach**: understanding Miriam’s audience, the publications she works with, the potential clients she will collaborate with, and the tone she brings to her reporting and communication strategies.  
This informed decisions on typography, layout, colour palette, the use of bespoke ribbons and animations, and the overall editorial feel of the website.

A core goal was to design a platform that felt **elegant, modern, and readable**, with an emphasis on:
- clean editorial layouts  
- intuitive mobile-first navigation  
- adaptable content structures for written, audio, and video journalism  
- a seamless bridge between journalism and communication services  
- a behind-the-scenes area as an opportunity for Miriam to introduce and explain her work and methods.

Responsive design was integral to the planning process. Since audiences frequently consume journalism on mobile devices, the entire site was built **mobile-first**, combining Bootstrap’s grid system with a fully custom design system. This ensures that the platform feels polished and consistent across all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Agile Methodology

The project followed an **Agile, iterative workflow**, with ongoing refinement as new content, design adjustments, and technical components were introduced.  
Features were developed in cycles, tested, adjusted, and refined continuously throughout the project rather than in fixed waterfall stages.

To maintain clarity and structure, we applied the **MoSCoW prioritization framework**.

This ensured delivery of a stable, fully functional platform while allowing space for future enhancements as Miriam’s portfolio and communication work evolves.

# Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were an important part of the early design phase.  
They were created by **Marie Pilot** using **Figma**, helping to map out the structure, hierarchy, and flow of the website across different screen sizes.

These wireframes provided a clear blueprint for:

[Wireframe - Splash page](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/splash.png)

[Wireframe - Splash mobile page](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/splash_mobile.png)

[Wireframe - Home page](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/homepage.png)

[Wireframe - 404 page](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/404.png)

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

To support the functionality of the **Miriam Gradel** portfolio website, the following Wagtail page types and related child items have been designed and implemented to manage the site’s content in the database.

Because this project is built with **Wagtail CMS**, the main content structure is represented through **Page models**, with in-page repeatable content handled via:
- `Orderable` + `ParentalKey` (for repeatable “rows” such as articles/audio/video items), and
- `StreamField` (for flexible, reorderable content blocks stored as structured JSON).

This allows the site owner to add, edit, and reorder content safely via the Wagtail admin panel without requiring developer support.

The **User** entity referenced in the ERD is **conceptual only**. No custom user profile model is implemented. Authentication and permissions are handled by Django and Wagtail’s built-in user system, restricting admin access to authorised users.

## Core Content Models (Wagtail Pages)

### Home & Landing Structure
- **WelcomePage**
  Stores:
  - `hero_text` (RichTextField)
  - `background_image` (FK → wagtailimages.Image)

### Theme

- White — #FFFFFF
- Black — #000000
- Cyan (Primary accent) — #73F0FA
- Soft Gray (Background/Neutral) — #F7F7F7
- Deep Cyan / Teal (Dark Accent Variant) — #1FB7C3 (used in hover states, active buttons, shadows, etc.)

![colour_palette](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/colorkit.png "colour_palette")

The visual identity for the **Miriam Gradel** platform was developed collaboratively with **Marie Pilot**, with the goal of creating a brand system that feels modern, editorial, and distinctively tied to Miriam’s journalistic style.  

Because the site focuses on journalism and communication, the visual language takes inspiration from **printed media** — especially the look of a **highlighter drawn across a newspaper or book margin**. This concept shaped the signature ribbon elements, cyan fins, and bold, contrast-heavy layouts. Blue is a personal favourite of th client.

### Typography

The typography of the **Miriam Gradel** platform is designed to feel **editorial, modern, and highly readable**, mirroring the experience of a clean, professional publication.  
The system uses two core fonts:  
- **Designer** — for expressive, statement-level headings  
- **TT Chocolates** — for all body text, subheadings, menus, captions, and UI elements

Together they create a balance between **bold personality** and **professional clarity**, suitable for long-form journalism, multimedia storytelling, and communication work.

**Designer** is a geometric, futuristic display typeface that gives the platform a distinctive identity.  
It is not used for body content, but only for visual highlights where strong character is needed.

![Cinzel](staticfiles/README_docs/images/Cinzel.png "cinzel")

**TT Chocolates** is a clean, modern sans-serif with excellent readability across mobile and desktop.  
Its soft geometry and range of weights (from ExtraLight to ExtraBold) allow for a fully flexible typographic hierarchy.

TT Chocolates is particularly suited for an editorial website because it provides:

- **High legibility** for long articles  
- **Neutral tone** that doesn’t distract from journalistic content  
- **Consistent rhythm and balance** across different content areas  
- **Professional yet warm personality**, aligning with Miriam’s brand

![Cinzel](staticfiles/README_docs/images/Cinzel.png "cinzel")

The result is a typographic system that feels **journalistic, contemporary, and unmistakably Miriam Gradel**.

# Deployment

## Github & Heroku Steps

### 1. Create the GitHub repository (Version Control)
- Create a new repository in GitHub.
- In the local project folder, initialise Git and push the project:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main
```
### 2. Create the Heroku application
- Go to the Heroku Dashboard.
- Click New → Create new app
- Choose:
  - App name (must be unique)
  - Region (Europe or United States)
- Click Create app

### 3. Configure Heroku Config Vars (no env.py used)

This project does not use an env.py file.
All sensitive environment variables are managed via Heroku Config Vars.

Steps:
- Open the Heroku app → Settings
- Click Reveal Config Vars
- Add the required variables.
- Variable names must match those referenced in settings.py.

### 4. Add the Heroku Postgres database
- In Heroku → Resources
- Add-on: Heroku Postgres
- This automatically injects the DATABASE_URL environment variable.

### 5. Prepare the project for Heroku deployment
- requirements.txt

  - Ensure all dependencies are listed:

  ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```

- Procfile

  - Create a file named Procfile (no file extension) in the project root:

  ```web: gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi```

  - Replace <project_name> with the Django project folder name.

### 6. Static files and media handling
- WhiteNoise is used to serve static files in production.
- Cloudinary is used for image and media storage.
- collectstatic runs during deployment.
- Any temporary DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable must be removed before production.

### 7. Email configuration (one.com)
- All transactional emails are handled via one.com email hosting
- Django is configured to use SMTP credentials provided by one.com
- No third-party email services (e.g. SendGrid) are used
This ensures:
- Emails are sent from the project’s own domain
- Full control over email delivery
- GDPR-friendly handling without external APIs

### 8. Deploy to Heroku using GitHub
- Go to Deploy in the Heroku app dashboard.
- Select GitHub as the deployment method.
- Connect the repository.
- Choose deployment option:
  - Enable Automatic Deploys (optional), or
  - Use Manual Deploy → select main → Deploy Branch
- Once completed, Heroku will confirm successful deployment.

## Final Production Configuration

1. **Update Django settings for production**:
In settings.py:
  - Set DEBUG to False
  - Configure allowed hosts:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "miriamgradel.cc",
    "www.miriamgradel.cc
    ",
    "<your-heroku-app-name>.herokuapp.com",
    ]

Recommended security setting:

```X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "SAMEORIGIN"```

2. **Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date**:
    - Run the following command to make sure all dependencies are listed:

```bash
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. **Clean up**:
- Ensure DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC is removed
- Confirm static files load correctly
- Verify database connection via Heroku Postgres
- Test contact form email delivery

4. **Custom Domain Configuration (One.com)**:
1. In Heroku → Settings → Domains
  - Add:
    - miriamgradel.cc
    - www.miriamgradel.cc
2. Heroku provides a DNS Target
3. In one.com DNS manager:
  - Add a CNAME record for www pointing to the Heroku DNS target
  - Configure the root domain using one.com’s supported ALIAS/ANAME method or forwarding
4. Ensure that the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in your settings.py includes your custom domain.
    ```bash
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']
    ```
      This tells Django to accept requests from your custom domain and ensures proper domain handling by Heroku.

## Bugs

This section outlines key issues encountered during development, their underlying causes, and the solutions implemented.

#### 1. **Bug: Featured Player Metadata Not Updating After Media Swap (Audio & Video Pages)**

**Problem:**  
On both the **Video** and **Audio** pages, when a user selected an item from the “Other Examples” grid, the embedded media correctly loaded into the featured player, but **only the title updated**.  
Other metadata — such as:
- description / standfirst
- publication date
- external link  
remained from the originally featured item or were cleared entirely.

This resulted in an inconsistent user experience where the player content and its contextual information did not match.

**Cause:**  
The initial implementation only swapped the **embedded media HTML** (`iframe`) and the **title field**.  
Key metadata (description, date, external URL) was:

- Rendered server-side for the first featured item only
- Not preserved in a reusable format
- Not stored in a way that could survive client-side swaps

Additionally:
- The description was rendered as rich text, making it unsafe to directly extract from the DOM
- Once replaced, there was no reference to restore the original featured content when swapping back

**Solution:**  

The fix was implemented consistently on **both the Video and Audio pages** using the same architecture.

**Key steps:**

1. **Metadata Caching via Data Attributes**  
   - All media cards now store their metadata (`title`, `date`, `description`, `external_url`) using `data-*` attributes.
   - Rich text descriptions are safely stored using escaped HTML (`escapejs`) to preserve formatting.

2. **Featured State Preservation**  
   - On initial page load, the original featured media’s:
     - embed HTML
     - metadata
   is cached in a hidden `<template>` and a hidden metadata store.
   - This allows the original featured item to be restored correctly when another item is promoted.

3. **Full Metadata Swap Logic**  
   - When a grid item is clicked:
     - The embedded media is swapped into the featured player
     - **All metadata fields** (title, date, description, link) are updated together
   - The previously featured item is demoted back into the clicked card with its full metadata restored.

4. **Shared, Reusable Logic**  
   - The same swap logic pattern is used for both **Video** and **Audio** pages.
   - This ensures consistent behavior and easier maintenance.

**Result:**  

- The featured player now **always displays the correct metadata** after a media swap.
- The original featured content is preserved and restored correctly.
- The interaction feels seamless and intuitive to the user.
- The solution is scalable, allowing editors to add unlimited media items without breaking layouts or behavior.
