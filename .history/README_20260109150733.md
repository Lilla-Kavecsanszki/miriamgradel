# Planning

The planning phase for the **Miriam Gradel** platform began with a strong emphasis on **brand definition**.  
Working closely with **Marie Pilot**, we developed a cohesive visual and narrative identity for Miriam, that reflects her voice and personality as a journalist, her professionalism, and the clarity and precision of her communication work.

Rather than relying on formal user personas, the direction was shaped through a **brand-driven approach**: understanding Miriam’s audience, the publications she works with, the potential clients she will collaborate with, and the tone she brings to her reporting and communication strategies.  
This informed decisions on typography, layout, colour palette, the use of bespoke ribbons and animations, and the overall editorial feel of the website.

A core goal was to design a platform that felt **elegant, modern, and readable**, with an emphasis on:
- clean editorial layouts  
- intuitive mobile-first navigation  
- adaptable content structures for written, audio, and video journalism  
- a seamless bridge between journalism and communication services  
- a behind-the-scenes area as an opportunity for Miriam to introduce and explain her work and methods.

Responsive design was integral to the planning process. Since audiences frequently consume journalism on mobile devices, the entire site was built **mobile-first**, combining Bootstrap’s grid system with a fully custom design system. This ensures that the platform feels polished and consistent across all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Agile Methodology

The project followed an **Agile, iterative workflow**, with ongoing refinement as new content, design adjustments, and technical components were introduced.  
Features were developed in cycles, tested, adjusted, and refined continuously throughout the project rather than in fixed waterfall stages.

To maintain clarity and structure, we applied the **MoSCoW prioritization framework**.

This ensured delivery of a stable, fully functional platform while allowing space for future enhancements as Miriam’s portfolio and communication work evolves.

# Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were an important part of the early design phase.  
They were created by **Marie Pilot** using **Figma**, helping to map out the structure, hierarchy, and flow of the website across different screen sizes.

These wireframes provided a clear blueprint for:

[Wireframe - Splash page](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/splash.png)

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

# Residenza 126

To support the functionality of the **Residenza 126** website, the following models have been designed and implemented to store essential property, user, and contact-related information in the database.

The **User** table in the ER diagram serves as a conceptual representation only. It does not directly correspond to the models in `models.py` or the actual physical database tables but offers a logical view of how data entities relate to each other. The **User** model handles the management of registered users, including their personal information, preferences, and interactions with properties.

The **Property** and **UserProfile** models are designed to handle the details of the properties available for viewing or purchase and the user profiles, respectively. These models store critical details such as property name, features, location, and user preferences for liked properties.

Additionally, the **Contact** model captures the information submitted by users via the contact form on the website. This model allows users to reach out with inquiries about the properties or any other questions they may have regarding **Residenza 126**. The form data is stored securely, including fields such as name, email address, phone number, message, and the date/time of submission.

The **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)** below illustrate how the models are interconnected, showcasing the relationships between users, properties, user profiles, and contact submissions. This ensures that all relevant data is properly organized and accessible for various website functionalities, such as property browsing, saving favorites, managing user profiles, and handling contact inquiries.

- UserProfile has a one-to-one relationship with User.
- UserProfile has a many-to-many relationship with Property through the liked_properties field.
- Property has a many-to-many relationship with User through the liked_by field.
- Property has one-to-many relationships with PropertyImage and PropertyVideo.
- Contact stands alone without direct relationships to the other models.

The following ER diagrams detail these relationships:

### Theme

- White — #FFFFFF
- Black — #000000
- Cyan (Primary accent) — #73F0FA
- Soft Gray (Background/Neutral) — #F7F7F7
- Deep Cyan / Teal (Dark Accent Variant) — #1FB7C3 (used in hover states, active buttons, shadows, etc.)

![colour_palette](miriamgradel/static/README_docs/images/colorkit.png "colour_palette")

The visual identity for the **Miriam Gradel** platform was developed collaboratively with **Marie Pilot**, with the goal of creating a brand system that feels modern, editorial, and distinctively tied to Miriam’s journalistic style.  

Because the site focuses on journalism and communication, the visual language takes inspiration from **printed media** — especially the look of a **highlighter drawn across a newspaper or book margin**. This concept shaped the signature ribbon elements, cyan fins, and bold, contrast-heavy layouts. Blue is a personal favourite of th client.

### Typography

The typography of the **Miriam Gradel** platform is designed to feel **editorial, modern, and highly readable**, mirroring the experience of a clean, professional publication.  
The system uses two core fonts:  
- **Designer** — for expressive, statement-level headings  
- **TT Chocolates** — for all body text, subheadings, menus, captions, and UI elements

Together they create a balance between **bold personality** and **professional clarity**, suitable for long-form journalism, multimedia storytelling, and communication work.

**Designer** is a geometric, futuristic display typeface that gives the platform a distinctive identity.  
It is not used for body content, but only for visual highlights where strong character is needed.

![Cinzel](staticfiles/README_docs/images/Cinzel.png "cinzel")

**TT Chocolates** is a clean, modern sans-serif with excellent readability across mobile and desktop.  
Its soft geometry and range of weights (from ExtraLight to ExtraBold) allow for a fully flexible typographic hierarchy.

TT Chocolates is particularly suited for an editorial website because it provides:

- **High legibility** for long articles  
- **Neutral tone** that doesn’t distract from journalistic content  
- **Consistent rhythm and balance** across different content areas  
- **Professional yet warm personality**, aligning with Miriam’s brand

![Cinzel](staticfiles/README_docs/images/Cinzel.png "cinzel")

The result is a typographic system that feels **journalistic, contemporary, and unmistakably Miriam Gradel**.

# Deployment

## Github & Heroku Steps

### 1. Create a Heroku application:
- Go to the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
- Click **"New"** in the top-right corner.
- Select **"Create new app"** from the dropdown.
- Fill in the following details:
  - **App name**: Your desired app name.
  - **Region**: Choose a region (United States or Europe).
- Click **"Create app"** to finalize the Heroku app creation.

### 2. Configure your Heroku app:
- Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
- Scroll to **Config Vars**, and click **"Reveal Config Vars"**.
- Add environment variables:

### 3. Set up your environment variables

### 4. Set up your GitHub repository (Version Control):
- Create a new **GitHub repository** through the GitHub UI.
- Initialize the repository in **VS Code** by opening the terminal in your workspace.
- **Push** the project to GitHub:
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
  git push -u origin master

### 5. Install dependencies:
In your **VS Code** terminal, install the necessary dependencies

### 6. Set up the Django project:
Create a **`requirements.txt`** file to list your project dependencies and save them.

Start the Django project and application:
- django-admin startproject PROJ_NAME .
- python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME

### 7. Configure environment variables in `env.py`:
Create a file named **`env.py`** in the root directory of your project, and define the necessary environment variables

### 8. Create the Procfile:
In the root directory, create the Procfile (no file extension)

### 9. Deploy to Heroku using GitHub:
1. Go to the **Deploy** tab on the Heroku dashboard for your app.
2. Under **Deployment method**, select **GitHub**.
3. Search for and select your GitHub repository.
4. You can enable **Automatic Deploys** or deploy manually:
   - **Automatic Deploys**: This will automatically deploy your app whenever you push changes to the selected branch.
   - **Manual Deploy**: To deploy manually, select the branch (e.g., **main**) and press **"Deploy Branch"**.

### 10. Build and deployment:
- Once the build process is complete, you’ll see **"Your app was successfully deployed"**.
- Click **"View"** to visit your live project.

## Final steps of deployment:
1. **Update Django settings for production**:
   - Set `DEBUG = False` in **`settings.py`**:
     - For security purposes, **`DEBUG`** should be set to **`False`** when deploying to production.
     - This prevents detailed error pages from being exposed to end-users.
   - Set `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'` in `settings.py` for added security:
      - This setting is important for preventing **clickjacking** attacks. **Clickjacking** occurs when a malicious site embeds your website inside a hidden iframe, tricking users into interacting with your site without their knowledge. This could lead to unintended actions, such as submitting forms or clicking on sensitive elements, potentially compromising user security. By setting `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'` in **`settings.py`**, you ensure that your site can only be embedded in iframes on the same domain, thereby reducing the risk of clickjacking attacks. This improves the security of your application by preventing other websites from embedding your pages within their own frames.

    - Add SendGrid to the email backend configuration in settings.py

2. **Ensure `requirements.txt` is up-to-date**:
    - Run the following command to make sure all dependencies are listed:

```bash
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. **Clean up**:

    - Remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var in Heroku.
    - Ensure WhiteNoise is set up for serving static files
    - PostgreSQL will be used for the database through Heroku.

4. **Custom Domain Configuration (One.com)**:

    - If you're using a custom domain through Squarespace, configure your DNS settings to point to Heroku. Heroku provides DNS targets in the Settings tab.
    - Ensure that the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in your settings.py includes your custom domain.
    ```bash
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']
    ```
      This tells Django to accept requests from your custom domain and ensures proper domain handling by Heroku.

## Bugs

This section outlines key issues encountered during development, their underlying causes, and the solutions implemented.

#### 1. **Bug: Featured Player Metadata Not Updating After Media Swap (Audio & Video Pages)**

**Problem:**  
On both the **Video** and **Audio** pages, when a user selected an item from the “Other Examples” grid, the embedded media correctly loaded into the featured player, but **only the title updated**.  
Other metadata — such as:
- description / standfirst
- publication date
- external link  
remained from the originally featured item or were cleared entirely.

This resulted in an inconsistent user experience where the player content and its contextual information did not match.

**Cause:**  
The initial implementation only swapped the **embedded media HTML** (`iframe`) and the **title field**.  
Key metadata (description, date, external URL) was:

- Rendered server-side for the first featured item only
- Not preserved in a reusable format
- Not stored in a way that could survive client-side swaps

Additionally:
- The description was rendered as rich text, making it unsafe to directly extract from the DOM
- Once replaced, there was no reference to restore the original featured content when swapping back

**Solution:**  

The fix was implemented consistently on **both the Video and Audio pages** using the same architecture.

**Key steps:**

1. **Metadata Caching via Data Attributes**  
   - All media cards now store their metadata (`title`, `date`, `description`, `external_url`) using `data-*` attributes.
   - Rich text descriptions are safely stored using escaped HTML (`escapejs`) to preserve formatting.

2. **Featured State Preservation**  
   - On initial page load, the original featured media’s:
     - embed HTML
     - metadata
   is cached in a hidden `<template>` and a hidden metadata store.
   - This allows the original featured item to be restored correctly when another item is promoted.

3. **Full Metadata Swap Logic**  
   - When a grid item is clicked:
     - The embedded media is swapped into the featured player
     - **All metadata fields** (title, date, description, link) are updated together
   - The previously featured item is demoted back into the clicked card with its full metadata restored.

4. **Shared, Reusable Logic**  
   - The same swap logic pattern is used for both **Video** and **Audio** pages.
   - This ensures consistent behavior and easier maintenance.

**Result:**  

- The featured player now **always displays the correct metadata** after a media swap.
- The original featured content is preserved and restored correctly.
- The interaction feels seamless and intuitive to the user.
- The solution is scalable, allowing editors to add unlimited media items without breaking layouts or behavior.
